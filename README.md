## Welcome to Deep Roots' document repository

Hello from Agile 2019!

We enjoyed teaching non-coders to teach coders how to refactor. Here are the materials for Read by Refactoring's Insight Loop!

You are free to use these in your organizations. Please don't offer public courses. If you want help sustaining these habits after the workshop, please contact us on Twitter at [@digdeeproots](https://twitter.com/digdeeproots)
