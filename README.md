### Materials for Non-Coders Teaching Coders How to Refactor

Here are the materials for Read by Refactoring's Insight Loop! Why? Because developers spend over half their time simply reading code. Get that time back for actual coding by helping them refactor as they read!

You are free to use these in your organizations. Please don't offer public courses. If you want help sustaining these habits after the workshop, please contact us!

### Why Remove All Bugs?

Because productivity increases. Because it lowers business risk. Because it allows continuous delivery. Because dogs do not get kicked at home.
